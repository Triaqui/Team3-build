Disk management:
================
Your operating system,applications, and data all need to be kept on some kind of permenent
storage so that when you turn off your computer and then ON again, your data is intack.
When you install the operating system, the disk is divided into one or more partions.
Disks: use for permenent storage
RAM(RandomAccessMemory): use for temporary storage
Swap: use for temporary storage
for example when you run a command, that command is copied from the hard disk into RAM so that
your computer processor(CPU) can access it quickly.
Disks commands:
  $ parted -l /dev/sda use to view partions
  $ fdisk -l /dev/sda use to format a drive
  $ lsblk to see the different partions bock
  $  mount use to munt a drive
  $ unmount use to unmount a drive
  /mnt is the default mount directory in linux
  $ mkdir /mnt/test
  $ mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/test
  $ df -h /mnt/sdb1
  fstab( File System Table)= use to permenently mount a drive to the file system
  /dev/sdb1   /mnt/test  xfs  defaults  0 1 is sample fstab entry
  xfs: is the filesystem
  defaults: means that the partition should be mounted at boot time
  number 0: tells the system not to backup files automatically from this filesystem
  number 1: tells the system to check the partition for errors after a certain number of mounts

  swap: Used for swap partitions.swap areas are used to hold data temporarily when RAM is used up.
        Data swapped to the swap area and then returned to RAM when it is needed again
  nfs: Network filesystem
  xfs: A high-performance filesystem originally developed by silicon graphics that works extremely well
       with large file.

  $ mkfs -t xfs /dev/sdc1  mkfs(make file system) is use to create a file system
  cat /etc/inittab
  File management: see previous video on handling files
  ===========================================================================
  chown is use to change ownership of a file or directory
  Process management: to be done together in class
  top = to check running processes
  ps -ef
  kill 1362
  kill -9 1362
  what is Daemon? it is background process in linux that ensures that other services are running and active
  list some deamons? answer: sshd, sssd, firewalld, cron, systemd, httpd etc..
  Network management: Which file is use to control ssh access into a linux system?
                      answer: sshd_config file
                      How do you check the content of your linux system NIC ?
                      answer: cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/eth0 (can be different for rhel or ubuntu)
    QUESTION: How do you troubleshoot a hostdown alerts?
            Answer: 1. ping the hostname and if your ping is negative then, the server is down

  Service Management: to be done together in class
  systemctl status <servicedaemon>
  curl <url> command is use to check url availability

  ls -lth to display files from biggest to smallest
  ls -lrth  to display files from smallest to biggest
  =======================================================================
  Steps to mount an ebs volume to an EC2 instance:
    1 create the ebs volume in aws 
    2 attach the ebs volume to the EC2 instance in same AZ(Availability zone)
    3 run the command "lsblk" to see it. notice 'xvdf' drive added
    4 sudo file -s /dev/xvdf to confirm it can contain data ':data' thats fine
    5 sudo partprobe /dev/xvdf -> to partition ready the disk
    6 sudo mkfs /dev/xvdf -t ext4 -> to format the drive with the ext4 filesystem
    7 sudo mkdir /mnt/test -> to creat a mountpoint
    8 sudo mount /dev/xvdf  /mnt/test to mount the new drive onto the system
    9 df -Th /mnt/test  to see that the drive has been properly mounted
    10 sudo vi /etc/fstab (This will enable the mounted drive to survive a system reboot)
        add the following line into the file
        /dev/xvdf   /mnt/test  ext4  defaults  0 1

         "End of steps"
